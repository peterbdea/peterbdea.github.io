          <h2>Ethics Essay</h3>
          <p class="date">Spring 2023</p>
          <p>Ethics is an important aspect of any company or organization that involves taking the correct actions based on a set of moral principles. Because of this importance, many organizations choose to install a “code of ethics,” which is a set of guidelines for how people are expected to act in order to fall within the morals of the organization. The code itself promotes ethical behavior in a way such that members of the organization will make decisions that are seen as morally good. It is important to have a code of ethics to establish a common understanding of what sort of behavior and decisions are expected of people within a group.</p>
            <p>Personally, when I am confronted with a situation that challenges me to think about ethics, I believe that it is very important for me to look at the issue with a level-headed perspective. I try to leave any biases that I might have aside and look at the issue in an objective way. I try to consider all of the factors of the problem and which ethical values are important in the situation. Before making any decisions I also try to weigh the consequences of any action that I might take before deciding on a final approach. It is also important to look at the situation from others’ perspectives in order to determine how my choices might effect the people around me.</p>
            <p>Many members of the group discussion I took part in chose to discuss the Amazon Echo issue. To summarize the issue, an amazon echo was present at the scene of a murder, and the authorities were trying to pressure Amazon into providing them with data from the Amazon echo in order to catch the murderer.</p>
            <p>This issue is a prime example of an ethical issue, as it raises questions about the responsibilities of large technology companies and what they are to do in order to protect the security and privacy of their customers. The case also does a good job at illustrating the conflicts between the public’s interest in their own privacy and the interests of law enforcement. Issues such as this one are becoming more and more common as technology continues to advance making it easier to gather and move data around the world. As companies continue to engage in these practices, it is important for them to consider the ethical implications of who has access to this data and how they can use it. Me and my classmates agreed that the case of Amazon Echo highlights the importance of developing clear guidelines and policies around data privacy and security to ensure that the public interest is protected while also respecting individual rights and freedoms.</p>
            <p>There are many different hard questions involved in this dilemma that call upon the different virtues of ethics. The biggest one I believe is Responsibility. Is it the responsibility of Amazon to disclose the data to authorities if it means making the world a safer place? Or is it the responsibility of Amazon to protect the private data of the users of its services in order to secure their trust.</p>
            <p> Another important one is honesty. If Amazon were to make its users believe that their information was safe from third parties access it, the issue of whether or not to allow anyone to access that data is one that challenges the honesty of Amazon as an institution. If Amazon were to violate their users’ trust and sell their data than they may break their honest reputation and violate another one of the virtues of ethics.</p>
            <p>The final one virtue of ethics I will touch on that this issue pertains to is integrity. The question of whether to give the authorities the data is a difficult one that challenges the morals of anyone who is confronted with it. It required Amazon as a company to make a choice between which moral principles they wanted to uphold, which is a difficult decision to make when the entire world is watching. The choice that Amazon made in the end was a significant indicator of the integrity of the company as a whole.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the importance of a code of ethics arises from its ability to ensure that the actions of a group of individuals within an organization are well able to align their principles and values. When faced with ethical dilemmas, it is crucial to approach the situation with a clear perspective, considering every factor to make a decision that aligns with the values that are deemed important. The Amazon Echo case demonstrates the need for clear guidelines about the ethics of a company in regard to data and security. It is not only important for Amazon as a company to do this, but for all of us to do our best to form ethical solutions in order to ensure that the common morals of mankind are upheld.</p>
