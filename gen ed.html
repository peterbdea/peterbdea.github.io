          <h2>General Education Reflection</h3>
          <p class="date">November 1st, 2024</p>
          <p>Throughout my time at Iowa State I have taken many general education courses, which are courses that focus primarily on non-STEM topics. The idea behind these courses is that it will help the student become a more well-rounded thinker and knowledgable on a variety of topics and not just super technical ones. In my personal opinion, I think it is especially valuable for engineering students to take these classes as I believe they are the courses that best encourage us to see things in a new light. It encourages us to broaden the scope of our problem solving skills and additionally see the problems we are solving in the context in which they exist.</p>
            <p>Perhaps my favorite general education elective I have taken at Iowa State was my Introduction to Philosophy class (PHIL 201). I have always been fascinated by philosophical debates and this was an excellent class which covered many of the debates. I also got to learn about some of the greatest philosophers of all time such as Socrates and Aquinas. What I liked most about philosophy was the sort of self-referential nature of it. A lot of the concepts can be described as “thinking about thinking” which inspired me to analyze my own knowledge, beliefs, and thought processes. I believe that this sort of introspection is extremely beneficial to engineering students. We can often get stuck in the same thought patterns which can lead us to be stuck on a problem for far too long, but learning about topics such as philosophy teaches us to take a step back and analyze the way in which we are going about thinking.</p>
            <p>In terms of seeing the context of the problems which I will be working on as an engineer, I think that the most beneficial general eduction class for me by far has been my microeconomics class. It is no doubt that tone of the most critical factors that keeps the world moving today is money and the economy. It relates everything we do and provides the fundamental incentives that keep nations moving forward. In order to understand most things in the world today and why they are the way they are it is crucial to understand how money works in our society. This class was an excellent introduction to the topic of economics for me. It taught me the fundamentals of economics such as supply and demand, how taxes work, and how different markets respond to change in prices. This information provided me with a valuable insight into the importance of keeping in mind economic principles throughout my time working as an engineer in the future. It also encouraged me to think about marginal benefits of different solutions more, which is a fundamentally different way of thinking than I was used to prior to taking the course.</p>
            <p>I believe that the general education courses that I have taken throughout my time at Iowa State have made me a more well-rounded individual. They have not only helped me see problems from new perspectives and broadened my ability for critical thinking, but they have also provided me with more context into the world that I live in and will soon be working in to make a better place. It is certainly my belief that all engineering students can see a similar benefit to general education courses and I will certainly encourage future engineering students to take advantage of the wonderful classes Iowa State has to offer.</p></p>
