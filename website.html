          <p class="date">November 11th, 2023</p>
          <p>In a way, this website has been in development for a long time. I began learning HTML and CSS in highschool, but this is my first time actually developing a website with it. For a class I took in my Spring 2023 semester, I was supposed to create a "portfolio website", which would display a project, an essay I had to write for that class, and contact information. I could have used a website that provided templates for making a website, but I wanted to have more control over my site and I wanted to understand the purpose of every line of HTML/CSS that made up the site. Because of this I decided to use my knowlege of HTML and CSS to create the whole thing from scratch. A while ago I bought the domain name peterdea.com and that is part of what inspired me to expand significantly on my portfolio and create what you see here.</p>
          <p>There are some more advanced CSS elements in this site now including scrolling divs which I use to display all of my classes and projects without taking up too much screen space. I have been learning a lot more about HTML and CSS throughout the development of this website and it has been really cool to be able to expand so much on my original concept.</p>
