          <h2>A Reflective Journey: Navigating Your Cumulative Experience at Iowa State University</h3>
          <p class="date">October 25th, 2024</p>
          <p>When I was in highschool, I was very uncertain about what I wanted to do when I grew
up. I was somewhat aware that I enjoyed STEM topics in school, but I did not know whether I
had what it took to be an engineer like my dad. I decided to enroll in community college for a
year after my graduation at DMACC. I enrolled in the Pre-Engineering program and during my
time studying this I discovered a passion for electrical engineering. That is when I realized I
wanted to transfer to Iowa State because I knew they had an excellent electrical engineering
program. In August of 2022, I enrolled at Iowa State as a sophomore by credits. In the years
since then during my time at Iowa State I have learned so much and have grown immensely as a
person.</p>
<p>During my first semester I immediately dove right into the deep-end of challenging
engineering courses such as MATH 207: Linear Algebra and EE 201: Electric Circuits. It was a
steep learning curve at first, but I began to find my stride as the semester progressed. Looking
back on it, I feel like my first year was all about developing a solid foundation in the electrical
engineering program at Iowa State.</p>
<p>However, It was not only STEM-related courses that I worked on during these early days.
In my first semester I took a course on microeconomics, which provided me with a great insight
of the context and the incentives in which my future areas of work would exist. Since then I have
learned to especially value my coursework in areas outside engineering. For example, I have
taken multiple history classes that have covered topics ranging from international affairs to early
American art. The value of these courses can often be overlooked by engineering students but for
me I have felt that they have provided me with a different perspective of the world around me. I
cannot be a good engineer without being a well-rounded individual, these courses especially
have helped me to develop in this regard.</p>
<p>As the semesters progressed I have taken on more and more difficult courses, many of
which have challenged me to come up with my own solutions to open-ended problems. These
classes are certainly where I have had the most fun, and I believe that they have developed my
engineering skills the most. There have been a number of projects that I can highlight from these
courses. The first big project I had assigned to me was an IR remote control in one of my electric
circuits classes. This would incorporate many topics I learned in this class such as filters,
amplifiers, and diodes. It was a little bit strange at first because no instructions were given to me.
There was no circuit diagram for me to follow, instead I had to design one myself. I had to take
all that I have learned and put it to practice in a way I had not done in college up to that point.
This was certainly one of the most challenging parts of my first year but also the part I remember
the most fondly. I was so proud of myself when I managed to create a working IR remote control
and it made me feel like I could accomplish anything.</p>
<p>Another such project that I am specifically proud of is my embedded systems project for
CPRE 288. I was working with a team to code a roomba to navigate a test field using the sensors
and motors incorporated in the device. This was one of the most fun projects I have ever worked
on. I have always been passionate about coding and it was very exciting to put this together with
the low-level electrical concepts that I had been learning up to that point. This is also a project in
which I went above and beyond all requirements for, the feeling of pride and accomplishment
was worth it alone to develop new functionality for the roomba, such as the user interface I spent
many late nights at Coover Hall working on. The adrenaline rush I felt when it was time to
finally present that final project was also extraordinarily intenseâ€“I did not know whether or not
we would make it in the real testfield. This made it that much more satisfying when we did end
up having one of the first successful projects, which makes this another project I look back at
rather fondly.</p>
<p>I certainly could not have gotten as far as I have if it were not the community and
resources that have been provided to me during my time at Iowa State. First and foremost I
would like to highlight the friends that I have made in my program who have always had my
back. We have always done what we can to help each other learn which has been an invaluable
resource and experience for me to have had. Iowa State has also provided me with access to
incredible resources such as the many books and journals at the library that have allowed me to
learn more about my course material outside of class. The university has provided me with a
number of online resources as well that I have utilized over the years in order to further my
understanding of the projects I am working on and the classes I have taken.</p>
<p>My time at Iowa State has not only been dedicated to studying and working on class
projects, however. I have also been connected to multiple opportunities to gain research
experience. The first case of this was during my REU (research experience for undergraduates)
for ARA: a wireless technology resource project at Iowa State. For this position I was
responsible for writing software for a health-monitoring framework for the computers within the
ARA network. This was a valuable resource for me to learn more about how academic research
works and also work hands-on on a professional level project.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this research project enough to continue to pursue another REU over the
summer of 2024 with Professor Duwe in his laboratory. For this experience I was tasked with
developing an embedded test-bed for a network of microcontrollers communicating amongst
themselves. This was a very challenging project as it was greatly involved with topics within
computer engineering, many of which I had not experienced before. For example, the software I
was writing for these microcontrollers was for a Real Time Operating System (RTOS), which is
significantly harder to work with than the other forms of operating systems that I have used. I
ended up having to teach myself about this complex topic using any resource I could get my
hands on. I found many online articles and videos that helped me understand how it works so
that I could progress on the development of this testbed.</p>
<p>Another experience I would like to highlight is my job working as a TA for the
introductory electric circuits class that I took in my first semester at Iowa State. This job (which I
am continuing to work on today) has allowed me to work closely with students in the laboratory
and practice my confidence and leadership skills in this environment. It has been an
exceptionally rewarding experience for me and I have greatly enjoyed working with my students.
Looking back at my experience at Iowa State, there are very few things that I would
change. I am very happy with the experiences I have had here and the skills they have taught me.
In fact, if I was able to go back knowing what I did now I would encourage myself to go to Iowa
State directly following high-school. Of course hindsight is 20/20, but I do believe that it could
have been valuable for me to have one more year here in order to get more comfortable with the
university before my courses became too challenging.</p>
<p>My time at Iowa State has been incredibly rewarding for me. I have learned so much
about a wide range of topics that cover many fields beyond just STEM. It has also allowed me to
acquire more depth in my knowledge of one specialized area that is electrical engineering. I
believe that the projects I have worked on and the classes I have taken have made me a very well
rounded person and have given me the expertise required in order for me to be a good engineer.</p>
