          <h2>Senior Design Project</h3>
          <p class="date">Fall 2024</p>
          <p>This semester, I began working on my senior design with a team of 3 other electrical engineering students. We are working on the project for our client, Honeywell National Security Campus. The premise of the project is to develop destructive and non-destructing evaluation methods in order to test a small deviceâ€™s electrical and mechanical properties. While the specific device in question is not of particular interest, the one we are working on for this project is a small rubber toy with a circuit inside it that flashes a pattern of LEDs on and off whenever a sufficiently strong external force is applied.</p>
          <p>In addition to creating evaluation methods to test for any defects, we are also trying to create methods to analyze whether the device been tampered with, as this is a crucial in areas of national security. This is where my personal role in the project comes in. I am currently working on swapping the integrated circuit within the device with a different one that will manipulate the functionality of the electric circuit. This will emulate the act of an adversary tampering with the device. Following the successful swap of the ICs, I will be able to test methods for detecting whether this tampering has occurred.</p>
          <p>This project ha incorporated and developed several skills in engineering disciplines. First of all, the IC I am working with is a very small, very basic microcontroller. This means I am able to incorporate my embedded systems knowledge. Additionally, this project has also required me to take many electrical measurements and has such strengthened my skills in using electrical testing equipment.</p></p>
          <p>The big picture of this project is to promote the creation of general evaluation methods for small electronic and mechanical systems. This is a topic of critical importance in national security which is why Honeywell is pursuing it with us.
